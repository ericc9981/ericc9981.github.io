    <p>I love my friends, my relatives, playing instruments, and most importantly the school NTCS! I love showing everyone my daily life, and along the process, get to get closer to all my friends and classmates!</p>

    <h3>Some of my hobbies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Playing the piano</li>
      <p>I love playing pieces on the piano to which I like, usually trickier classical pieces such as Turkish Marcy by Mozart.</p>
      <li>Playing the guitar</li>
      <p>I love being able to play even more pieces of music on the guitar, for example, Perfect by Ed Sheeran.</p>
      <li>Coding</li>
      <p>I enjoy coding at...</p>

      <li>I have table tennis intramurals later on. Hopefully, all the lessons that I got can really help me during the game! I want to be at least top 3 and get into the table tennis team, because honestly, that's literally the only thing that I'm good at haha.</li>
      <li>I got closer to my friends, especially Alvin and Arthur, and especially Arthur, as he has helped me with this coding thing! I would've gotten a bad mark if it wasn't for him. Thank you Arthur! If you read this, hello...</li>
      <li>I ended up actually getting third place! Not bad, but not great. This year, I'm actually trying in school and I have great marks so I think that's good. I do hope I can stop being a whiny perfectionist and do my best in the Science Fair project though, as my expectations!</li>
      <li>I think that while I'm pretty good at these projects, I'm not as good as a typical girl would be. If it doesn't look that well or as my expectations, then I'd be mad at myself. I think I should start to practice and improve on that or perhaps work with somebody who's capable of that. I'm pushing myself to the limits this year! I regretted wasting my potential for the last 2 years.</li>
      <li>I received my term 1 report card. I think that was pretty impressive, although I do wish for more. I actually got on the leaderboard for BCC, I plan to continue to do the best especially in Gauss. An issue though is that I'm trying to win competitions, awards, and whatnot for the desire of my heart and attention from others, but not to glorify God. I hope that however the performance that I make in these competitions, however I come off as to the teachers, with the Holy Spirit they will make the decision that comes off as the best, and whichever one is chosen is the best/right one, even if I don't see it as the best.</li>
