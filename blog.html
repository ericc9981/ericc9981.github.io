    <p>I unfortunately was not being a very smart person and forgot to do the blog from the verse first day of release. I do know though, I learned how to create this little
    website here by watching Brainy Robo (a YouTube Channel)'s video and learning from my teacher! The website was created before I could even guess, although I started
      to work on it starting February 10th, 2025. I will continue to update this web page as I learn new skills. :) </p>
